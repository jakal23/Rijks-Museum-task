# Rijks-Museum-task

Rijksmuseum is an android application for online investigating museum arts.
We provides a lot of information about art makers and pictures.


The Rijksmuseum is the national museum of the Netherlands.
We tell the story of 800 years of Dutch history, from 1200 to now. 
In addition, we organize several exhibitions per year from our own collection and with (inter) national loans.
